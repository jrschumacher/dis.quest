# AGENTS.md

This project enables authenticated user experiences using [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app), built in Go. It uses lexicons to define data structures and interactions within the app view.

---

## 🧭 Project Philosophy

- Users authenticate with ATProtocol and manage their own data via their Personal Data Server (PDS).
- Each user's data is structured using lexicons and stored in their own PDS whenever possible.
- The app aims for lightweight, interoperable experiences within the ATProtocol ecosystem.

## 🔐 Auth & Data Model

- **Authentication** uses ATProtocol and Bluesky identity.
- Each user's lexicon data must be stored in their **own PDS**, with the exception of:
  - Public data (e.g. `Topic` fields) that is shared across users.
- All interactions, updates, and data writes are scoped to the authenticated user.

## 📁 Generated Files

These generated files must be committed:

- `*_templ.go` (from `templ`)
- Code generated by `sqlc`
