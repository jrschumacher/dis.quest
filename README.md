# dis.quest ‚Äî Go POC for ATProtocol Discussions

This project is an experimental implementation of a secure, discussion-style messaging protocol using [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com/) and optionally [OpenTDF](https://github.com/virtru/OpenTDF).

## Features

- Custom lexicons under `quest.dis.*` and `quest.dis.sec.*`
- Discussion topics, messages, participation tracking
- Optional encrypted messaging using OpenTDF-style fields
- Q&A support via `selectedAnswer` on topics
- Targeting full PDS/AppView compatibility
- Written in idiomatic Go

## Project Background and Purpose

`dis.quest` is a prototype implementation of a discussion-based messaging platform built on ATProtocol. It is designed to model GitHub-style discussions (topics, replies, participation), while optionally supporting encrypted message content using OpenTDF. The project is exploring how decentralized, attribute-based access control (ABAC) can integrate with federated discussion threads.

Key architectural ideas include:
- Each post is a custom record (e.g., `quest.dis.post`) with optional OpenTDF-protected payloads
- All messages in a thread can be encrypted under a unified OpenTDF policy
- Embeds (e.g., media blobs) are encrypted and referenced using the ATProto blob store
- Custom lexicons define topics, messages, participation, and security contexts

While OpenTDF integration is being explored as part of this prototype, it is not a core feature of the base discussion experience. Instead, it serves as a demonstration of how the ATProtocol and its lexicon system can be extended to support encrypted payloads and attribute-based access control. This includes the ability to define and use additional lexicons that go beyond the app-specific view, opening the door to broader interoperability and experimentation.

## Scope

This project is intentionally limited in scope to prioritize core discussion features and integration with ATProtocol and OpenTDF.

### ‚úÖ In Scope

- **Topic** ‚Äî Represents a discussion subject with an initial message and metadata
- **Topic Category** ‚Äî Grouping or classification (e.g., hashtags) to organize topics
- **Participation** ‚Äî Opt-in to follow a topic and receive updates or reply notifications
- **Top-Level Message** ‚Äî A direct response to a topic
- **Thread** ‚Äî Replies to a top-level message, supporting conversational depth
- **Emoji Reactions** ‚Äî Non-verbal message responses (e.g., üëç ‚ù§Ô∏è üî•)
- **Upvotes** ‚Äî Lightweight endorsement signal for a message or thread
- **Q&A Topics** ‚Äî Threads with an accepted answer (stored in `selectedAnswer`)
- **Mentions (`@handle`)** ‚Äî Notifies tagged users (planned)
- **WebSocket subscriptions** ‚Äî Realtime updates for followed discussions (planned)
- **Attachments** ‚Äî Encrypted media or files associated with a post
- **Defined Categories** ‚Äî Predefined list of categories for browsing and filtering topics

### üö´ Out of Scope

- **Polls** ‚Äî Voting-based discussions
- **Direct Messaging** ‚Äî 1:1 or group chat support
- **Private Threads** ‚Äî Topics with per-message visibility restrictions
- **Rich Text Editors** ‚Äî Markdown/WYSIWYG formatting is deferred to the client layer

## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup
```bash
# Complete development environment setup
task dev-setup
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature from GitHub issue
task worktree-dev ISSUE=123

# Daily development cycle
task dev-check                 # Generate code + lint + test
task commit-check              # Validate before committing
task pr-create                 # Submit pull request

# After PR merge
task worktree-cleanup BRANCH=issue-123
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the server (multiple options)
task run                       # Using Taskfile (recommended)
go run main.go                 # Direct Go execution
make run                       # Using Makefile
```

### Getting Help
```bash
task welcome                   # Welcome message and quick start
task quickstart                # Interactive quickstart guide
task help                      # Comprehensive help (opens in pager)
task --list                    # Show all available tasks
task help-claude               # Commands for Claude Code assistance
```

## Working with Claude Code

This project is optimized for collaboration with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). For best results:

### Starting a Session
```bash
task claude-context           # Provide complete project context to Claude Code
```

### Getting Help
```bash
task project-health           # Comprehensive project status
task docs-status              # Check documentation freshness
task help-claude              # Show Claude Code assistance commands
```

### Development Best Practices
- Use `task` commands instead of manual git/tool operations
- Run `task dev-check` before committing
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` as the authoritative development guide
- Use GitHub issues and worktrees for feature development

See `CLAUDE.md` for complete development workflow documentation.
