## Architecture Alignment Notes

**‚úÖ Implemented and Aligned**:
- Database-first approach with type-safe queries matches ADR-0001 constraints
- Flat threading model (topic ‚Üí post ‚Üí reply) implemented in schema
- Custom lexicon namespace (quest.dis.*) properly defined
- Development workflow matches CLAUDE.md specifications exactly

**üöß Partially Aligned**:
- Lexicon structure matches PRD specifications but not yet implemented in code
- Handler organization follows documented patterns but lacks business logic
- Authentication infrastructure exists but needs completion

**‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps to Address**:
- No actual ATProtocol integration beyond authentication scaffolding
- Missing user context propagation from authentication to data operations
- Templates exist but not connected to real data

This plan prioritizes completing the core discussion functionality first, then progressively enhancing with ATProtocol integration and advanced features. The optional OpenTDF encryption remains as a future extension without blocking core development.
